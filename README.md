Pre-built binaries are available on our [releases page](https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clSPARSE/releases)

# clSPARSE
an OpenCL&copy; library implementing Sparse linear algebra.  This project is a result of
a collaboration between [AMD Inc.](http://www.amd.com/) and
[Vratis Ltd.](http://www.vratis.com/).

## Introduction to clSPARSE
At this time, clSPARSE provides these fundamental sparse operations for OpenCL:
-  Sparse Matrix - dense Vector multiply (SpM-dV)
-  Sparse Matrix - dense Matrix multiply (SpM-dM)
-  Iterative conjugate gradient solver (CG)
-  Iterative biconjugate gradient stabilized solver (BiCGStab)
-  Dense to CSR conversions (& converse)
-  COO to CSR conversions (& converse)
-  Functions to read matrix market files in COO or CSR format

True in spirit with the other clMath libraries, clSPARSE exports a “C” interface to allow
projects to build wrappers around clSPARSE in any language they need.  A great deal
of thought and effort went into designing the API’s to make them less ‘cluttered’
compared to the older clMath libraries.  OpenCL state is not explicitly passed
through the API, which enables the library to be forward compatible when users are
ready to switch from OpenCL 1.2 to OpenCL 2.0 _(OpenCL 2.0 support not completely finished)_

The API’s are designed such that users are in control of where input and output
buffers live, and they maintain control of when data transfers to/from device
memory happen, so that there are no performance surprises.

### Google Groups
Two mailing lists have been created for the clMath projects:

-   clmath@googlegroups.com - group whose focus is to answer
    questions on using the library or reporting issues

-   clmath-developers@googlegroups.com - group whose focus is for
    developers interested in contributing to the library code itself

### API semantic versioning
Good software is typically the result of the loop of feedback and iteration;
software interfaces no less so.  clSPARSE follows the
[semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines, and while the major version
number remains '0', the public API should not be considered stable.  We release
clSPARSE as beta software (0.y.z) early to the community to elicit feedback and
comment.  This comes with the expectation that with feedback, we may incorporate
breaking changes to the API that might require early users to recompile, or rewrite
portions of their code as we iterate on the design.

## Samples
clSPARSE contains a directory of simple [OpenCL samples](./samples) that demonstrate the use
of the API in both C and C++.  The [superbuild](http://www.kitware.com/media/html/BuildingExternalProjectsWithCMake2.8.html)
script for clSPARSE also builds the samples as an external project, to demonstrate
how an application would find and link to clSPARSE with cmake.

### clSPARSE library documentation
**API documentation** is not yet available, but the samples above give an excellent
starting point to basic library operations.

### Contributing code
Please refer to and read the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) document for guidelines on
how to contribute code to this open source project. Code in the
/master branch is considered to be stable and new library releases are made
when commits are merged into /master.  Active development and pull-requests should
be made to the **/develop** branch.

## Build
clSPARSE is primarily written with C++ using C++11 core features.  It does export
a 'C' interface for compatibility with other languages.

### How to build clSPARSE for your platform
