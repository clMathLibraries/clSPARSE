# clSPARSE
an OpenCL&trade; library implementing Sparse linear algebra routines.  This project is a result of
a collaboration between [AMD Inc.](http://www.amd.com/) and
[Vratis Ltd.](http://www.vratis.com/).

### What's new in clSPARSE **v0.8**
- New single precision SpM-SpM (SpGEMM) function
- Optimizations to the sparse matrix conversion routines
- [API documentation](http://clmathlibraries.github.io/clSPARSE/) available
- SpM-dV routines now provide [higher precision accuracy] (https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clSPARSE/wiki/Precision)
- Various bug fixes integrated


## clSPARSE features
-  Sparse Matrix - dense Vector multiply (SpM-dV)
-  Sparse Matrix - dense Matrix multiply (SpM-dM)
-  Sparse Matrix - Sparse Matrix multiply Sparse Matrix Multiply(SpGEMM) - Single Precision
-  Iterative conjugate gradient solver (CG)
-  Iterative biconjugate gradient stabilized solver (BiCGStab)
-  Dense to CSR conversions (& converse)
-  COO to CSR conversions (& converse)
-  Functions to read matrix market files in COO or CSR format

True in spirit with the other clMath libraries, clSPARSE exports a “C” interface to allow
projects to build wrappers around clSPARSE in any language they need.  A great deal
of thought and effort went into designing the API’s to make them less ‘cluttered’
compared to the older clMath libraries.  OpenCL state is not explicitly passed
through the API, which enables the library to be forward compatible when users are
ready to switch from OpenCL 1.2 to OpenCL 2.0 <sup>[1](#opencl-2)</sup>

### clSPARSE library documentation
**API documentation** is now available http://clmathlibraries.github.io/clSPARSE/ . The included samples will give an excellent
starting point to basic library operations.

### Google Groups
Two mailing lists have been created for the clMath projects:

-   clmath@googlegroups.com - group whose focus is to answer
    questions on using the library or reporting issues

-   clmath-developers@googlegroups.com - group whose focus is for
    developers interested in contributing to the library code itself

### API semantic versioning
Good software is typically the result of the loop of feedback and iteration;
software interfaces no less so.  clSPARSE follows the
[semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines, and while the major version
number remains '0', the public API should not be considered stable.  We release
clSPARSE as beta software (0.y.z) early to the community to elicit feedback and
comment.  This comes with the expectation that with feedback, we may incorporate
breaking changes to the API that might require early users to recompile, or rewrite
portions of their code as we iterate on the design.

## clSPARSE Wiki
The [project wiki](https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clSPARSE/wiki) contains helpful documentation, including a [build primer](https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clSPARSE/wiki/Build)


### Contributing code
Please refer to and read the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) document for guidelines on
how to contribute code to this open source project. Code in the
/master branch is considered to be stable and new library releases are made
when commits are merged into /master.  Active development and pull-requests should
be made to the **develop** branch.

## Samples
clSPARSE contains a directory of simple [OpenCL samples](./samples) that demonstrate the use
of the API in both C and C++.  The [superbuild](http://www.kitware.com/media/html/BuildingExternalProjectsWithCMake2.8.html)
script for clSPARSE also builds the samples as an external project, to demonstrate
how an application would find and link to clSPARSE with cmake.

## Build
clSPARSE is primarily written with C++ using C++11 core features.  It does export
a 'C' interface for compatibility with other languages.

### How to build clSPARSE for your platform
A [Build primer](https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clSPARSE/wiki/Build) is available on
the wiki, which describes how to use cmake to generate platforms specific build
files

### Compiling for Windows
-  Windows&reg; 7/8
-  Visual Studio 2013 and above
-  CMake 2.8.12 (download from [Kitware](http://www.cmake.org/download/))
  -  Solution (.sln) or
  -  Nmake makefiles
-  An OpenCL SDK, such as [APP SDK 3.0](http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/)

### Compiling for Linux
-  GCC 4.8 and above
-  CMake 2.8.12 (install with distro package manager )
   -  Unix makefiles or
   -  KDevelop or
   -  QT Creator
-  An OpenCL SDK, such as [APP SDK 3.0](http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/)

### Compiling for Mac OSX
-   CMake 2.8.12 (install via [brew](http://brew.sh/))

### Bench & Test infrastructure dependencies
-   Googletest v1.7
-   Boost v1.58

## Clarifications
<a name="opencl-2">[1]</a>: OpenCL 2.0 support is not yet fully implemented; only the interfaces have been designed
